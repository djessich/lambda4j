     * the act of throwing a checked exception from the java compiler.
     * <p>
     * Note: that this method has a return type of {@code RuntimeException}. It is therefore advised you always call
     * this method as argument to the {@code throw} statement to avoid compiler errors regarding no return statement and
     * similar problems. This method won't, of course, return an actual {@code RuntimeException}. It never returns, it
     * always throws the provided exception.
     *
     * @param t The throwable to throw without requiring you to catch its type.
     * @return A dummy RuntimeException; this method never returns normally, it <em>always</em> throws an exception.
     * @throws NullPointerException If given argument was {@code null}
     * @implNote This method should be safe, but use with care.
