/**
 * The {@link Runnable} interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a
 * thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called {@link #run()}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that wish to execute code while they are active.
 * For example, {@code Runnable} is implemented by class {@link Thread}. Being active simply means that a thread has
 * been started and has not yet been stopped.
 * <p>
 * In addition, {@code Runnable} provides the means for a class to be active while not subclassing {@code Thread}. A
 * class that implements {@code Runnable} can run without subclassing {@code Thread} by instantiating a {@code Thread}
 * instance and passing itself in as the target. In most cases, the {@code Runnable} interface should be used if you are
 * only planning to override the {@link #run()} method and no other {@code Thread} methods. This is important because
 * classes should not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental behavior of
 * the class.
 * <p>
 * This is a {@link FunctionalInterface} whose functional method is {@link #run()}.
 *
 * @param <X> The type of the throwable to be thrown by this runnable
 * @apiNote This is a throwable JDK lambda.

    /**
     * Returns a composed {@link Runnable2} that applies this runnable to its input and sneakily throws the thrown

     * throwable thrown from the returned composed runnable behaves exactly the same as an <em>unchecked</em> throwable
     * does. As a result, there is no need to handle the throwable of this runnable in the returned composed runnable by
     * either wrapping it in an <em>unchecked</em> throwable or to declare it in the {@code throws} clause, as it would
     * be done in a non sneaky throwing runnable.
     * <p>
     * What sneaky throwing simply does, is to fake out the compiler and thus it bypasses the principle of
     * <em>checked</em> throwables. On the JVM (class file) level, all throwables, checked or not, can be thrown
     * regardless of the {@code throws} clause of methods, which is why this works at all.
     * <p>
     * However, when using this method to get a sneaky throwing runnable variant of this throwable runnable, the
     * following advantages, disadvantages and limitations will apply:
     * <p>
     * If the calling-code is to handle the sneakily thrown throwable, it is required to add it to the {@code throws}
     * clause of the method that applies the returned composed runnable. The compiler will not force the declaration in
     * the {@code throws} clause anymore.
     * <p>
     * If the calling-code already handles the sneakily thrown throwable, the compiler requires it to be added to the
     * {@code throws} clause of the method that applies the returned composed runnable. If not added, the compiler will
     * error that the caught throwable is never thrown in the corresponding {@code try} block.
     * <p>
     * If the returned composed runnable is directly surrounded by a {@code try}-{@code catch} block to catch the
     * sneakily thrown throwable from it, the compiler will error that the caught throwable is never thrown in the
     * corresponding {@code try} block.
     * <p>
     * In any case, if the throwable is not added to the to the {@code throws} clause of the method that applies the
     * returned composed runnable, the calling-code won't be able to catch the throwable by name. It will bubble and
     * probably be caught in some {@code catch} statement, catching a base type such as {@code try { ... }
     * catch(RuntimeException e) { ... }} or {@code try { ... } catch(Exception e) { ... }}, but perhaps this is
     * intended.
     * <p>
     * When the called code never throws the specific throwable that it declares, it should obviously be omitted. For
     * example: {@code new String(byteArr, "UTF-8") throws UnsupportedEncodingException}, but {@code UTF-8} is
     * guaranteed by the Java specification to be always present. Here, the {@code throws} declaration is a nuisance and
     * any solution to silence it with minimal boilerplate is welcome. The throwable should therefore be omitted in the
     * {@code throws} clause of the method that applies the returned composed runnable.
     * <p>
     * With all that mentioned, the following example will demonstrate this methods correct use:
     * <pre>{@code
     * // when called with illegal value ClassNotFoundException is thrown
     * public Class<?> sneakyThrowingFunctionalInterface(final String className) throws ClassNotFoundException {
     *     return ThrowableFunction.of(Class::forName) // create the correct throwable functional interface
     *                .sneakyThrow() // create a non-throwable variant which is able to sneaky throw (this method)
     *                .apply(className); // apply non-throwable variant -> may sneaky throw a throwable
     * }
     *
     * // call the the method which surround the sneaky throwing functional interface
     * public void callingMethod() {
     *     try {
     *         final Class<?> clazz = sneakyThrowingFunctionalInterface("some illegal class name");
     *         // ... do something with clazz ...
     *     } catch(ClassNotFoundException e) {
     *         // ... do something with e ...
     *     }
     * }
     * }</pre>
     * In conclusion, this somewhat contentious ability should be used carefully, of course, with the advantages,
     * disadvantages and limitations described above kept in mind.
