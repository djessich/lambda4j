     * the {@code throws} clause anymore.
     * <p>
     * If the calling-code already handles the sneakily thrown throwable, the compiler requires it to be added to the
     * {@code throws} clause of the method that applies the returned composed function. If not added, the compiler will
     * error that the caught throwable is never thrown in the corresponding {@code try} block.
     * <p>
     * If the returned composed function is directly surrounded by a {@code try}-{@code catch} block to catch the
     * sneakily thrown throwable from it, the compiler will error that the caught throwable is never thrown in the
     * corresponding {@code try} block.
     * <p>
     * In any case, if the throwable is not added to the to the {@code throws} clause of the method that applies the
     * returned composed function, the calling-code won't be able to catch the throwable by name. It will bubble and
     * probably be caught in some {@code catch} statement, catching a base type such as {@code try { ... }
     * catch(RuntimeException e) { ... }} or {@code try { ... } catch(Exception e) { ... }}, but perhaps this is
     * intended.
     * <p>
     * When the called code never throws the specific throwable that it declares, it should obviously be omitted. For
     * example: {@code new String(byteArr, "UTF-8") throws UnsupportedEncodingException}, but {@code UTF-8} is
     * guaranteed by the Java specification to be always present. Here, the {@code throws} declaration is a nuisance and
     * any solution to silence it with minimal boilerplate is welcome. The throwable should therefore be omitted in the
     * {@code throws} clause of the method that applies the returned composed function.
     * <p>
     * With all that mentioned, the following example will demonstrate this methods correct use:
     * <pre>{@code
     * // when called with illegal value ClassNotFoundException is thrown
     * public Class<?> sneakyThrowingFunctionalInterface(final String className) throws ClassNotFoundException {
     *     return ThrowableFunction.of(Class::forName) // create the correct throwable functional interface
     *                .sneakyThrow() // create a non-throwable variant which is able to sneaky throw (this method)
     *                .apply(className); // apply non-throwable variant -> may sneaky throw a throwable
     * }
     *
     * // call the the method which surround the sneaky throwing functional interface
     * public void callingMethod() {
     *     try {
     *         final Class<?> clazz = sneakyThrowingFunctionalInterface("some illegal class name");
     *         // ... do something with clazz ...
     *     } catch(ClassNotFoundException e) {
     *         // ... do something with e ...
     *     }
     * }
     * }</pre>
     * In conclusion, this somewhat contentious ability should be used carefully, of course, with the advantages,
     * disadvantages and limitations described above kept in mind.
     *
     * @return A composed {@link CharFunction} that applies this function to its input and sneakily throws the thrown
     * {@link Throwable} from it, unless it is of type {@link RuntimeException} or {@link Error}.
     * @implNote If thrown {@link Throwable} is of type {@link RuntimeException} or {@link Error}, it is thrown as-is
     * and thus not sneakily thrown.
